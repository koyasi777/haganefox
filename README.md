# Haganefox

**Your Firefox, forged into steel.**

---

## Concept

`Haganefox` is a Firefox `user.js` configuration designed to transform your browser into a tool as robust and practical as forged steel.

The word **"Hagane" (鋼)** means *steel* in Japanese—a material prized not only for its strength but also for its flexibility and resilience. True steel isn’t just hard; it’s tempered to be both tough and workable.  
This configuration embodies that dual nature:

- **Steel-like Hardness:** Relentless focus on privacy and security, inheriting the hardened stance of [arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js).
- **Steel-like Flexibility:** Inspired by [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox), with practical, real-world performance tuning that improves responsiveness without sacrificing usability.

Haganefox doesn’t just defend—it sharpens and streamlines your entire browsing experience.

## Key Features

- **Steel-Clad Security**  
  Built on the arkenfox foundation, Haganefox fortifies Firefox against modern web threats like tracking, fingerprinting, and data leakage.

- **Sharp Performance**  
  Optimized network, rendering, and cache settings for a lightweight, responsive feel—especially on developer workflows and power usage.

- **Practical Strength**  
  Avoids extreme or brittle settings that break websites. Balances strong security with real-world usability.

- **Well-Documented**  
  Every setting is clearly commented for full transparency and ease of customization.

- **Quality of Life Enhancements**  
  Includes UI/UX tweaks and developer-friendly switches to improve everyday comfort and utility.

## Intended Users

- Users who want to harden Firefox without degrading the user experience.
- Developers and power users who want fast, responsive performance with thoughtful defaults.
- Anyone who has struggled with breakages from strict configurations like RFP, and seeks a more usable alternative.

## Installation

1. In Firefox, type `about:support` into the address bar and hit Enter.
2. Find the **"Profile Folder"** entry and click **"Open Folder"**.
3. Place your `user.js` file into this folder.  
   **⚠️ Important:** The file must be named exactly `user.js`. Firefox only auto-loads settings from this filename.
4. Restart Firefox to apply the configuration.

> 💡 This repository also includes **`user-ja.js`**, a version with Japanese comments.  
> If you use it, make sure to rename it to `user.js` before placing it in your profile folder.

## Disclaimer

- This configuration is a personal custom build. Use it **at your own risk**.
- Some websites may break or behave unexpectedly due to hardened security.
- You are strongly encouraged to review the settings and make sure they match your usage needs and threat model.
