# üî© Haganefox üî©

**Your Firefox, forged into steel.**

---

## üß† Concept

`Haganefox` is a Firefox `user.js` configuration designed to transform your browser into a tool as robust and practical as forged steel.

The word **"Hagane" (Èãº)** means *steel* in Japanese‚Äîa material prized not only for its strength but also for its flexibility and resilience. True steel isn‚Äôt just hard; it‚Äôs tempered to be both tough and workable.  
This configuration embodies that dual nature:

- **Steel-like Hardness:** Relentless focus on privacy and security, inheriting the hardened stance of [arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js).
- **Steel-like Flexibility:** Inspired by [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox), with practical, real-world performance tuning that improves responsiveness without sacrificing usability.

Haganefox doesn‚Äôt just defend‚Äîit sharpens and streamlines your entire browsing experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. In Firefox, type `about:support` into the address bar and hit Enter.
2. Find the **"Profile Folder"** entry and click **"Open Folder"**.
3. Place your `user.js` file into this folder.  
   **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** The file must be named exactly `user.js`. Firefox only auto-loads settings from this filename.
4. Restart Firefox to apply the configuration.

> üí° This repository also includes **`user-ja.js`**, a version with Japanese comments.  
> If you use it, make sure to rename it to `user.js` before placing it in your profile folder.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

- This configuration is a personal custom build. Use it **at your own risk**.
- Some websites may break or behave unexpectedly due to hardened security.
- You are strongly encouraged to review the settings and make sure they match your usage needs and threat model.
